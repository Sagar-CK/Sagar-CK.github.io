I recently switched my website's layout, but why? Above all, I wanted something **easy to maintain**, **configurable**, and **minimalistic**. The old layout of my website was fine, but since it was built using [T3](https://create.t3.gg/), sometimes it was tedious to make even minor content updates.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/announcement_2/sagarspace.png" title="Old website layout" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/announcement_2/sagarspace3.png" title="Old website layout"  class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/announcement_2/sagarspace2.png" title="Old website layout"  class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

What am I using now you may ask?

#### [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)

Yes, another [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme...

However, as someone who never used a static site generator before, I must admit the convinence is unparalled. Till now, I have developed my own portfolio sites from scratch or through helpful quick-start resources (like the one provided for the T3 stack). Here are some things I noticed immediately:

<ul>
    <li>Adding content is super easy; markdown coupled with some [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) scripts get the job done.</li>
    <li>Organization and integrations are seamless.</li>
    <li>Styling and formatting is more intuitive.</li>
</ul>

Although, one could argue that these observations are a result of belief-bias, I have observed after working with jekyll and my old website's codebase for the past week, most of my slight annoyances seemed to have dissapeared. As a result, I would recommend anyone who has been debating the effectivness and customizability that jekyll offers compared to your own developed website, to give it a shot!

So now back to the main point --- what can you find here?

As opposed to my older websites/portfolios, I would now like to put more focus onto informative, regular, and compact updates. This could range anywhere from random thoughts on SEO optimization to a quick summary of a [medium](https://medium.com/@sagar.chethankumar) article I recently worked on.

> I recently wanted to get back into technical writing (like some blog posts) after going through some old lecture slides. I initially was inspired by a Data Mining lecture hosted by [Nergis TÃ¶men](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab/people/nergis-toemen) covering recommender systems (including [NMF](https://medium.com/logicai/non-negative-matrix-factorization-for-recommendation-systems-985ca8d5c16c))!

TLDR: I switched to a new website layout. This means you can expect smaller and more regular updates (like small blog posts).

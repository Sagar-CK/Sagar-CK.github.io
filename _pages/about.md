I am a final-year student in Computer Science at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). At TU Delft, I currently serve as an honors board member, teaching assistant, research assistant, and student mentor.

My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), natural language processing (NLP), and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, I am passionate about understanding how AI systems can be designed and integrated into human contexts effectively. Here, "effectively" encompasses both task-related metrics (e.g., task performance or efficiency) and behavioral metrics (e.g., trust or usability). With this focus, I aim to develop novel methods and interaction paradigms that foster the appropriate reliance of humans on AI systems.

Additionally, I have a strong enthusiasm for teaching! While I am yet to obtain my [University Teaching Qualification (UTQ)](https://www.tudelft.nl/teaching-support/training-events/university-teaching-qualification-utq-bko) — or its equivalent — I thoroughly enjoy contributing to course design, student assessment, and lecture preparation. For more details, feel free to explore the "teaching" section. :grin:

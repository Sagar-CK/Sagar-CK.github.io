As part of the penultimate year of the [Computer Science and Engineering bachelor at TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/computer-science-and-engineering/bachelor-of-computer-science-and-engineering) students need to participate in the CSE2000 Software Project course, where over the course of 10 weeks with a group of 5 students the team produces a product that is commissioned by a client and solves a real-world problem.

In my case I was working with my friends and fellow TAs [Samuel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeywenyili/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bm7GwwbG3Tz2zW6V28tiWvg%3D%3D), [Tejas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejaskochar20/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bm7GwwbG3Tz2zW6V28tiWvg%3D%3D), [Joey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeywenyili/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bm7GwwbG3Tz2zW6V28tiWvg%3D%3D), and [Neel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neel-lodha/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bm7GwwbG3Tz2zW6V28tiWvg%3D%3D) at [PwC](). As a result of the internship we developed an AI-powered, currently still confidential, tool that is now being prepared to go into production for internal use.

The project offered me a valuable opportunity to contribute to a cutting-edge solution with the potential to significantly enhance PwC's operations and advance the field. It was also one of my first professional experiences in designing and implementing a hybrid human-AI tool for a high-risk domain like finance.

I will always cherish the time spent with my group, experiencing both the lows and the highs. I still vividly remember our anxiousness before presenting the product to global leadership and our muted cheers of joy during the final presentation when our demo went as expected.

All in all the project deepened my passion for AI and its transformative potential across various industries. Contributing to the development of this innovative tool at PwC was incredibly rewarding, and I look forward to seeing where the tool will go in the future!

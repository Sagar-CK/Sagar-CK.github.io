I am excited to announce that alongside [Neel Lodha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neel-lodha/), [Manu Gautam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manu-gautam-6b5064259/), and [Atilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atilla-colak/), we have co-founded **ANDL** (AI-Nspired Digital Learning)!

As mentioned in a previous post, ANDL started as a winning project at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam) Innovation Lab's AI in Education Hackathon](https://advalvas.vu.nl/en/science-education/ai-hackathon-winner-wants-tackle-crowded-campus). We pitched ANDL as a hybrid Human-AI decision-based, peer-to-peer, and student/teacher analytic-driven platform üè´.

Now a little over a year later we have worked towards estalishing ANDL as a responsible and explainable AI platform for education. As a new edtech start-up, we are currently in the process of developing our platform and are looking for educators, students, and researchers to learn more about their needs and how we can help them.

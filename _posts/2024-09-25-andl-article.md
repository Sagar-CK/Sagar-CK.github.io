Hey everyone! I am excited to share that we have published a new technical whitepaper on **ANDL's** approach to AI in education. The whitepaper is titled: **Appropriate Reliance & AI: Trusting AI Responsibly** and is available to read on our LinkedIn page [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andl-ai_appropriate-reliance-ai-trusting-ai-responsibly-activity-7242997264510595072-EHhj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)! ðŸ“š

In the whitepaper, we discuss the importance of appropriate reliance on AI systems in education and how we can design AI systems that are both trustworthy and transparent. We also introduce the concept of **ANDL's** AI Trust Framework and how it can be used to evaluate the trustworthiness of AI systems in education.

If you are interested in learning more about **ANDL** and our approach to AI in education, please visit our website [here](https://andl.io) or reach out to me directly at [sagar@andl.io](mailto:sagar@andl.io)! ðŸš€
